  Management of Static API Keys.
  
  A Static API Key is:
    - A pre-defined API key that is associated (statically) with a Rate Plan.
    - An example is Tenant ID associated to a tenant SLA-related Rate Plan.
    - Static API keys can also be utilized as authorization tokens for your API consumers.

  A Dynamic API Key is:
    - An API key that is assigned a Rate Plan at runtime (instead of statically pre-associated).
    - Use these when there are a large quantity or they cannot be know beforehand.
    - Some examples are IP address, user ID, device ID.
    - Dynamic values can be pulled from the request context via scripting and used for Dynamic API keys.
