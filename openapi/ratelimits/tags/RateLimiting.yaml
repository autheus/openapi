  Rate-limiting oriented requests.

  An API gateway or other application calls the `/limits` endpoint to see if the request is allowed or denied.
  - The response returns a 'decision' property containing `ALLOW` or `DENY` that the application or API gateway uses to enforce the decision.
  - A rate-limiting request includes data from the original request such as headers and other parameters (maybe even from the body). This
  becomes the request context from which Policy script snippets can extract values.
  - It also includes the Policy (either the `slug` or `ID`) that should be applied to the request. __NOTE:__ Using the `ID` is more performant than using the `slug`.
  - The execution of the Policy causes counters to be maintained in the system tracking API Key counters against their associated Rate Plans.
