  Management of Rate-Limting Policies.

  A Policy stitches API keys, rate plans and JWT verifiers together into an enforcable set of rules. It is used at run-time to enforce rate-limits and, optionally, authorization.

  Each category of API call in your system will have different Policies to enforce SLAs.

  A Policy is made up of the following rules or statements:
    * Authorization Statement (see below)
      - Only included if authorization enforcement at the edge is desired.
      - An Authorization Statement can enforce Static API Key or OAuth2 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) JWT verification authorization.
    * API Key Statements
      - An array of Static and/or Dynamic API Keys on which to enforce rate-limiting (via Rate Plans).
      - Dynamic API Keys are associated to a Rate Plan in the API Key Statement.
      - Static API Keys do not include a Rate Plan in the statment.
      - API Key values can be extracted from the incoming request context using script snippets.
      - One or more API Key Statements must be present in the Policy.
    * Error Handling Statement
  # Authorization Statements
    - By including an Authorization Statement in a rate-limiting Policy, the Policy can perform request authorization by validating an API Key or a Java Web Token (JWT).
    * API Key Authorization
        - Static API Keys can be validated in requests to authorize API consumers by using scripting in the Policy to extract the API key from the request.
        - If the Static API Key exists, the consumer is assumed to be authorized.
        - Not as secure as using JWT authorization (below).
    * Java Web Token Authorization
        - Configuring a JWT Verifier and including it in a rate-limiting Policy enables issuer, audience, expiration and signature validation for incoming requests.
        - Validates tokens at the edge so invalid tokens don't load up back-end services.
        - Script snippets can be included in issuer and audience configuration to enable dynamic validation with values substituted from the incoming request context
        (e.g. a multi-tenant authorization server).
