name: Rate Plans
description: |
  Management of individual rate plans.

  A RatePlan defines quota and/or throttling (aka spike arrest) configuration that can be applied to both static or dynamic API keys during a rate-limiting decision request.

  For example, there may be rate plans for tenants, applications, devices, all with different quota and throttling characteristics.

  Each Rate Plan can have either or both of 'quota' and 'throttle':
  - Quota is a fixed-time window rate-limit over an hour, day, week or month. Quota applies SLAs or license limits to API consumers.
  - Throttle is a rolling window of budgeted usage for traffic-shaping over a shorter time period of hours, minutes, or seconds.
